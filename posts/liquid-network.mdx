Quick Start with JUNGLELABᵀᴹ

JungleLab LNFT Digital Assets is a web-based platform for issuing and transacting with non-fungible tokens on the Bitcoin Liquid Network. 
Blockstream is sponsoring its development and hosting an exemplary curated instance of it for use by Bitcoin artists at JungleLab.

Features

JUNGLELABᵀᴹ 
User accounts and profiles for artists and collectors include custom avatars, contact info and biography
Users can follow other artists and collectors and like/favorite individual artworks

Artists can upload digital media files (jpg, png, gif, mp4) representing an artwork and add metadata like a title, description, and tags
Selected metadata is published in the liquid asset registry so that tokens can be recognized by external wallets

Media files are added to the IPFS network upon being uploaded and are given a unique content identifier (CID) derived from the SHA256 hash of the file
The CID is embedded in the Liquid token issuance transaction contract, permanently and provably linking the file to the token
Artworks are listed in a searchable/sortable/filterable marketplace gallery

Artists can list an artwork for sale by setting an optional listing price, royalty rate, and/or auction period
Bids and sales are conducted peer-to-peer using atomic swaps so the platform host does not need to escrow funds
Listings, bids, transfers and new artwork activity are logged and presented in a site-wide feed

A web-based liquid wallet is integrated into the user's profile page and allows them to fund their accounts with L-BTC or any kind of liquid asset
Wallets can be backed up and imported using a 12-word BIP mnemonic seed phrase

Built-in integration with the coinos.io API allows users to instantly convert BTC to L-BTC by depositing to an on-chain address or paying a lightning network invoice
Royalties and auction holding periods are enforced through a 2-of-2 signing server that only signs off on transactions that meet certain conditions
